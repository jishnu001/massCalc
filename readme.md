silly java app to calculate the mass of each element in a compound
for eg : it helps you calculate the mass of Na and Cl in say 10g of NaCl

"Usage : <no of elements in compound> <ele1 symbol> <no of ele1 atoms> <ele2 symbol> <no of ele2 atoms> ... <weight of the compound in grams> "

eg MgCl2: 2	Mg	1	Cl	2	100
